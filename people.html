                        Peter Kekenes-Huskey, Ph.D. (PI) is an associate professor at Loyola University Chicago. 
                
                        He graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of North Carolina Asheville (2001), which was followed by a Fulbright Fellowship to Germany, whereafter he obtained his Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology (2009). 
                        At UNC Asheville, he developed algorithms for the ab initio prediction of halogenated ethane decomposition rates as a Barry Goldwater Scholar with Bert Holmes and George Heard (UNCA).  
                        His Ph.D. research with William A. Goddard, III (Caltech) focused on developing Monte Carlo tools and molecular dynamics simulations. 
                        Peter complemented his studies with applied mathematics and computer science coursework from algorithm design to parallel computing, in fulfillment of National Science Foundation and Department of Energy Computional Science Graduate Fellowships. 
                        Following his Ph.D. work, he worked as a Staff Scientist at Arete Associates from 2007 to 2010, where he developed near-real time image processing and signal detection algorithms for defense applications. 
                        Returning to his passion for the physical sciences, he pursued postdoctoral studies with Professors Andy McCammon (Chemistry) and Andrew McCulloch (Bioengineering) at the University of California San Diego under support of American Heart Association and National Institutes of Health fellowships, to understand cardiac calcium signaling using molecular dynamics, partial differential equations and systems biology models. 
                        <br>
                        In 2014, he began his independent career in the Chemistry Department at U Kentucky, where his lab studied multi-physics descriptions of molecular-driven events with macro-scale phenomena, with myriad applications in biological and nanoscale systems. 
                        His lab moved to Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine in 2019 to build an experimental complement to his computational research directions.                 
                        As an independent investigator, he has been recognized for this work through becoming the first <a href="https://nigms.nih.gov/Research/mechanisms/MIRA">Maximizing Investigators' Research Award</a> recipient at the University of Kentucky (<a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/research/kekenes-huskey-receives-uks-first-nih-mira-award-medical-research">Link</a>) and being named as the Stritch School of Medicine's Senior Scientist of the Year (<a href="https://hsd.luc.edu/research_services/content/stalbertsday/">Link</a>).

                            At UNC Chapel Hill, Celia Shiau has a tenured Associate Professor position in the departments of biology and microbiology & immunology.  She received her PhD from Caltech in developmental neurobiology using the chick model system and in vitro systems in the lab of Marianne Bronner. She then completed her postdoctoral research in glial biology and macrophages at Stanford University using zebrafish genetics and cutting-edge microscopy in the lab of Will Talbot. Dr. Shiau's research focuses on mechanisms that regulate macrophage cell states in a variety of physiologically relevant environments, such as the brain and the gut, as well as fundamentals concerning the function of the immune system in tissue development and homeostasis. Through Loyola's Cardiovascular Research Institute and the funding from the CVRI Innovation & Exchange Scholar program, she is excited to make advancements in cutting-edge research in cardiovascular science.

After graduating from Illinois Institute of Technology, Xuan joined the PKH lab in Jan, 2020. Having survived five brutal Chicago winters, he has developed a skill set in biochemical and biophysical characterization of proteins. His main research interest lies in the understanding of enzyme mechanisms on the molecular level, using both computational and experimental techniques. Outside the lab, Xuan is a big fan of basketball, beer, and Rock music. Fun fact, when time permits, Xuan also does micro home brew with his buddies. Best batch so far is a pineapple wheat ale with a really refreshing fruity taste (Recipe available upon request).

                        Rohan is a sophmore majoring in Bioinformatics. Rohan started working in the PKH lab during his freshman year. In the PKH lab, Rohan is currently working on coding a model of negative feedback inhibition on the PI3K-Akt-PTEN pathway by implementing a Goodwin Oscillator in python. This model to investigate the kinetics of said feedback inhibition to potentiate immune cell anti-tumor pathways.
